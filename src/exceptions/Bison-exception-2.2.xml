    <body>
      <p>As a special exception, you may create a larger work that
         contains part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and
         distribute that work under terms of your choice, so long as
         that work isn't itself a parser generator using the skeleton
         or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton.
         Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute the parser
         skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this special
         exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
         Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
         License without this special exception.</p>
      <p>This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation
         in version 2.2 of Bison.</p>
